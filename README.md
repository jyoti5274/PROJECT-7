# PROJECT-7
Propensity Model to identify how likely certain target groups customers respond to the marketing campaign


Propensity Modeling for Insurance Marketing
This document outlines the approach to building a propensity model for identifying potential insurance customers based on historical data provided by the insurance company.


Deliverables:



A report (PDF) detailing:
Design choices and model performance evaluation
Discussion of future work
Source code used to create the pipeline (Python script)
Tasks:

Data Collection:

Download the "Propensify.zip" file containing the data.
Extract the training data (train.csv) and testing data (test.csv).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze data types and identify missing values.
Perform descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of variables.
Create visualizations (histograms, boxplots) to identify potential outliers and relationships between features.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values through imputation techniques (e.g., mean/median imputation, mode imputation) or removal based on severity.
Address outliers using capping or winsorization techniques.
Standardize numerical features (e.g., scaling) for improved model performance.
Encode categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding) if necessary.
Dealing with Imbalanced Data:

Analyze the class imbalance (proportion of potential customers vs. non-customers) in the training data.
Apply techniques like oversampling (replicating minority class data) or undersampling (reducing majority class data) to balance the data.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features based on domain knowledge and EDA insights (e.g., interaction terms, binning categorical features).
Perform feature selection techniques (e.g., correlation analysis, feature importance from models) to identify the most relevant features.
Model Selection and Training:

Split the preprocessed training data into training and validation sets (e.g., 80%/20%).
Train and evaluate several classification models suitable for binary classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score to evaluate model performance on the validation set.
Choose the model with the best performance on the validation set.
Model Validation:

Evaluate the chosen model on a separate hold-out test set (if available) to assess its generalizability to unseen data.
Analyze the model's confusion matrix to understand its strengths and weaknesses in predicting potential customers.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the chosen model using techniques like grid search or randomized search to optimize its performance.
Model Deployment:

Develop a plan for deploying the model in a production environment, including considerations for infrastructure, data access, and real-time predictions.
Testing Candidate Predictions:

Use the trained model to predict the probability of being a potential customer for each candidate in test.csv.
Apply a threshold (e.g., 0.5) to classify candidates into "Market (1)" or "Don't Market (0)".
Documentation:

Create a README file explaining the installation and execution of the pipeline script.
Describe in the final report how the model benefits the insurance company by optimizing marketing efforts and targeting high-potential customers.

Future Work:

Explore advanced feature engineering techniques like feature importance analysis or dimensionality reduction.
Evaluate the performance of different balancing techniques and their impact on model results.
Consider incorporating customer segmentation strategies for targeted marketing campaigns.

Success Metrics:

Model accuracy on test data > 85% (benchmark)
Implementation of hyperparameter tuning
Model validation on a separate test set (if available)
Bonus Points:

Package the solution as a ready-to-use pipeline with a README file.
Demonstrate strong documentation skills highlighting the value proposition of the model for the insurance company.
Tools and Libraries:

Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Additional libraries depending on chosen models (e.g., xgboost for Gradient Boosting)
